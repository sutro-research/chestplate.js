## Chestplate

A small set of helpers for Backbone. Docs coming soon!

* Defining "local-only" attributes that will never be sent to the server

* More flexible options for parsing/serialization

* Computed attributes

* 1-way model-view data binding

* An implementation of the Presenter pattern

* (Completely optional) sane default view rendering to cut down on duplication
